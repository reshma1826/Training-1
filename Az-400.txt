Continuous Deployment


Azure DevOps -- SaaS Platform from microsoft that end-to-end devops tool chain

			Jira (boards) -- Github -- Jenkins -- Nagios
			Azure Boards -- Azure Repo -- Azure Pipelines

dev.azure.com

			Organization -- Devops Account name , can contain multiple projects
				Allow users to seperate projects ,control access,Split the code,tests and pipelines
  --  Project  -- places for users to plan,track progress and collab building solutions
 
Azure DevOps Components
	Boards -- Track work
	Pipelines -- Build and Deploy
	Repos -- Cloud Based Source Control
	Test Plans -- Test Apps

			Integrate -- Github,Slack
		
Azure Boards
	Work Item 
	Backlogs
	Sprint
	Dashboards

All processes -- Basic -- when your team wants simplest model that uses issues,Tasks,Epics to track work

Agile -- 


Make Org Settings to Agile

--------------------------------------

Sprint -- Short term, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete set of work

		2 week sprint
		Tasks:
				Create App Server
				Create DB Server


Epics -- Can be broken down into specific pieces of work called Features
	Needs and Requests from the Customer or end users and is sized or split necessary to be delivered by the agile teams
--------------------------------------
Manage Source Control

Using Central Version Control System : TFVC -- Team Foundation Version Control
	Developers can used	to record changes that are made their source code files over time
		ability to revert back to previous file version or previous to previous

		Compare the changes between one version to another version
		git -- tool
Use Case:
		Large Code Base
		Specify fine grain permissions at the file level
		lock files if required

Distributed Version SYstem -- Ex.Git

	Developer will create local copy of the entire repository -- Local Branch/New branch
	WIll make the changes and commits locally
	Pushes to the Changes to the server
